I recently watched the following egghead.io course:

[Write simple asynchronous code with JavaScript generators](https://egghead.io/courses/write-simple-asynchronous-code-with-javascript-generators)

In this repo, I am playing around with the code from lesson 6:

[Use JavaScript (ES6) generators with Promises to handle async flows](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-javascript-es6-generators-with-promises-to-handle-async-flows)
